Project: Probability of Failure Analysis Using SOSPA Method
Currently pursuing B.Tech in Civil and Infrastructure Engineering at IIT Jodhpur under the supervision of Dr. Amit Kumar Rathi.

Introduction
This project aims to find the probability of failure (pf) using the Second Order Second Moment (SOSPA) method. The problem is solved using specific code provided in this repository, which transforms a general quadratic limit-state function into a linear combination of chi-square distribution variables and evaluates the accuracy of the SOSPA method for reliability analysis, particularly for quadratic limit-state functions.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze the probability of failure using the SOSPA method. The limit-state function used in this analysis 
The accuracy of the SOSPA method is evaluated, and the results are compared with other standard methods.

Methodology
Limit-State Function Transformation: The quadratic limit-state function is transformed into a linear combination of chi-square distribution variables.
SOSPA Method Implementation: The SOSPA method is applied to evaluate the probability of failure.
Comparison with Other Methods: The results are compared with other reliability analysis methods to validate the accuracy of SOSPA.
Code
The code used for this analysis is provided in this repository. It includes:

Python scripts for transforming the limit-state function.
Implementation of the SOSPA method.
Comparative analysis with other methods.
